# Altis Python Path

This folder contains two modules Toontown Project Altis requires to run.

altispatch contains an older version of urlparse due to issues running the
integrated version.

raven contains a modified version of
[https://github.com/getsentry/raven-python/tree/2.0.x]. Only modification done
is to use urlparse from the altispatch module.
